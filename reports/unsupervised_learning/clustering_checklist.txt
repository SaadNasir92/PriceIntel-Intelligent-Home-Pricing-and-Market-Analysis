# Clustering Analysis Project Checklist

## 1. Feature Streamlining
**Objective**: Reduce dimensionality and focus on most impactful features.
- [ ] Aggregate closing date features into broader time periods
- [ ] Apply feature importance techniques:
  - [ ] Mutual Information for categorical features
  - [ ] F-test for numerical features
- [ ] Select top 20-30 most influential features
- [ ] Re-run K-means clustering with reduced feature set
- [ ] Compare clustering results (full vs. reduced feature set)

**Importance**: Addresses high dimensionality, improves interpretability and performance.

## 2. Validation and Robustness Check
**Objective**: Ensure reliability and validity of clustering results.
- [ ] Perform silhouette analysis to measure cluster quality
- [ ] Run Hierarchical Clustering for comparison
- [ ] Compare results between K-means and Hierarchical Clustering
- [ ] Adjust approach if necessary based on findings

**Importance**: Validates the clustering approach before deep diving into characterization.

## 3. Cluster Characterization and Business Insights
**Objective**: Develop actionable profiles for each cluster.
- [ ] Analyze cluster centroids in detail
- [ ] Create concise profiles for each cluster, focusing on:
  - Demographic characteristics
  - Property preferences
  - Financial indicators
  - Sentiment patterns
- [ ] Identify key differentiators between clusters
- [ ] Develop specific marketing and sales recommendations for each cluster

**Importance**: Translates technical results into actionable business insights.

## 4. Create Visualizations for Stakeholder Communication
**Objective**: Effectively communicate clustering insights to non-technical stakeholders.
- [ ] Develop 3-5 key visualizations:
  - [ ] 2D PCA plot of clusters
  - [ ] Radar charts of cluster characteristics
  - [ ] Bar charts of key feature distributions across clusters
- [ ] Create an interactive dashboard (if resources allow)

**Importance**: Enhances understanding and adoption of insights across the organization.

## 5. Sentiment Analysis Deep Dive
**Objective**: Understand factors driving customer sentiment in different segments.
- [ ] Analyze distribution of sentiment scores within each cluster
- [ ] Identify key factors contributing to sentiment variations
- [ ] Extract common themes from customer feedback in high/low sentiment clusters

**Importance**: Provides additional context to cluster profiles and insights.

## 6. Develop Simple Predictive Model
**Objective**: Create a tool for assigning new customers to clusters.
- [ ] Develop a Random Forest classifier using cluster labels as target variable
- [ ] Use only features available at customer acquisition or early lifecycle
- [ ] Evaluate model performance using cross-validation
- [ ] Create a simple interface for model usage

**Importance**: Enables practical application of clustering insights to new data.

## 7. Scalability Test
**Objective**: Validate findings on the full 250,000 customer dataset.
- [ ] Run optimized clustering algorithm on full dataset
- [ ] Compare results with 50,000 sample analysis
- [ ] Identify any new patterns or insights from larger dataset

**Importance**: Ensures insights are representative of the entire customer base.

## 8. Documentation and Integration Planning
**Objective**: Ensure clear communication of project methodology and findings.
- [ ] Document detailed methodology
- [ ] Summarize key findings and their business implications
- [ ] Develop plan for integrating insights into marketing and sales processes
- [ ] Create presentation for executive stakeholders

**Importance**: Facilitates understanding, adoption, and application of project outcomes.

## Notes for Implementation:
- Modify existing code in clustering.py and cluster_main.py to incorporate new analyses.
- Add methods for additional analyses (e.g., silhouette analysis, hierarchical clustering).
- Expand visualize_clusters method to include new visualizations.
- Implement new methods for sentiment analysis and predictive model development.
- Continuously update documentation throughout the project.

Remember to review and adjust this checklist as needed throughout the project. Each step should be thoroughly reviewed before moving to the next, allowing for adjustments based on findings.
