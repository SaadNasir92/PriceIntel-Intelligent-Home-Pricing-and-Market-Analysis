# Clustering Analysis Project Plan

## 1. Project Overview

### Objective
Develop a customer segmentation model using K-means clustering to provide actionable insights for marketing and sales strategies in the housing market.

### Current Status
- Initial K-means clustering performed on a 50,000 sample dataset
- 5 clusters identified
- 1,498 features used in the initial analysis

### Key Challenges
- High dimensionality of the dataset
- Need for actionable insights
- Balancing depth of analysis with practical outcomes

## 2. Action Plan

### 2.1 Streamline Feature Set

#### Objectives
- Reduce noise and redundancy in the dataset
- Focus on the most impactful features for clustering

#### Tasks
1. Aggregate closing date features into broader time periods (e.g., months or quarters)
2. Apply feature importance techniques:
   - Mutual Information for categorical features
   - F-test for numerical features
3. Select top 20-30 most influential features
4. Re-run K-means clustering with reduced feature set

#### Deliverables
- List of top 20-30 features with importance scores
- Comparative analysis of clustering results (full vs. reduced feature set)

### 2.2 Cluster Characterization and Business Insights

#### Objectives
- Develop clear, actionable profiles for each cluster
- Translate clustering results into business insights

#### Tasks
1. Analyze cluster centroids in detail
2. Create concise profiles for each cluster, focusing on:
   - Demographic characteristics
   - Property preferences
   - Financial indicators
   - Sentiment patterns
3. Identify key differentiators between clusters
4. Develop specific marketing and sales recommendations for each cluster

#### Deliverables
- Detailed cluster profiles (1-2 pages per cluster)
- Summary of key business insights
- Set of actionable recommendations for marketing and sales teams

### 2.3 Validation and Robustness Check

#### Objectives
- Ensure reliability and validity of clustering results

#### Tasks
1. Perform silhouette analysis to measure cluster quality
2. Run Hierarchical Clustering for comparison
3. Compare results between K-means and Hierarchical Clustering

#### Deliverables
- Silhouette score analysis report
- Comparative analysis of K-means vs. Hierarchical Clustering results

### 2.4 Develop Simple Predictive Model

#### Objectives
- Create a tool for assigning new customers to clusters

#### Tasks
1. Develop a Random Forest classifier using cluster labels as target variable
2. Use only features available at customer acquisition or early lifecycle
3. Evaluate model performance using cross-validation
4. Create a simple interface for model usage

#### Deliverables
- Trained Random Forest classifier
- Model performance report
- User guide for model application

### 2.5 Create Visualizations for Stakeholder Communication

#### Objectives
- Effectively communicate clustering insights to non-technical stakeholders

#### Tasks
1. Develop 3-5 key visualizations:
   - 2D PCA plot of clusters
   - Radar charts of cluster characteristics
   - Bar charts of key feature distributions across clusters
2. Create an interactive dashboard (if resources allow)

#### Deliverables
- Set of static visualizations (3-5 high-quality charts/graphs)
- Interactive dashboard (optional, based on resources)

### 2.6 Sentiment Analysis Deep Dive

#### Objectives
- Understand factors driving customer sentiment in different segments

#### Tasks
1. Analyze distribution of sentiment scores within each cluster
2. Identify key factors contributing to sentiment variations
3. Extract common themes from customer feedback in high/low sentiment clusters

#### Deliverables
- Sentiment analysis report
- List of key factors influencing customer sentiment by cluster

### 2.7 Scalability Test

#### Objectives
- Validate findings on the full 250,000 customer dataset

#### Tasks
1. Run optimized clustering algorithm on full dataset
2. Compare results with 50,000 sample analysis
3. Identify any new patterns or insights from larger dataset

#### Deliverables
- Comparative analysis report (50K vs. 250K results)
- Summary of any new insights gained from full dataset

### 2.8 Documentation and Integration Planning

#### Objectives
- Ensure clear communication of project methodology and findings
- Prepare for integration of insights into business processes

#### Tasks
1. Document detailed methodology
2. Summarize key findings and their business implications
3. Develop plan for integrating insights into marketing and sales processes
4. Create presentation for executive stakeholders

#### Deliverables
- Comprehensive project documentation
- Integration plan for marketing and sales teams
- Executive summary presentation
