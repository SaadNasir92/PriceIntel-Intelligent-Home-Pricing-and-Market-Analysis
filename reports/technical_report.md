# Housing Price Prediction Project: Detailed Timeline and Reasoning

## 1. Project Initiation and Data Generation

### Timeline: Weeks 1-2

#### Initial Concept
- Goal: Develop a comprehensive housing price prediction model with an interactive UI
- Reasoning: To create a tool that could revolutionize pricing strategies in the real estate market

#### Synthetic Data Generation
- Tool: CTGAN (Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks)
- Process: Multiple iterations to refine data quality
- Challenges:
  1. Ensuring realistic correlations between features
  2. Matching distributions to real-world housing data scenarios
- Reasoning for Synthetic Data: Lack of access to large-scale, real-world housing data; need for a controlled dataset to prove concept

## 2. NLP Sentiment Analysis

### Timeline: Week 3

#### Implementation
- Tool: VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)
- Key Additions:
  1. Custom lexicon for real estate-specific terms
  2. Refined scoring for mixed sentiments
- Reasoning: To extract valuable insights from textual feedback, potentially improving prediction accuracy

#### Integration
- Added sentiment scores to the main dataset
- Purpose: Enhance both supervised and unsupervised models with sentiment data
- Reasoning: Hypothesis that customer sentiment could be a significant factor in housing prices

## 3. Predictive Model Development

### Timeline: Weeks 4-6

#### Initial Approach
- Comprehensive pipeline development
- Models: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Network (Keras)
- Scalers: Standard, Robust, MinMax
- Evaluation: 5-fold cross-validation, multiple metrics (RMSE, MAE, R2)
- Reasoning: To thoroughly explore and compare various modeling approaches

#### Challenges and Adjustments
1. Computational Constraints
   - Action: Reduced dataset from 250K to 50K samples
   - Reasoning: Balance between model accuracy and computational feasibility
2. Time Constraints
   - Action: Focused on top-performing models and scalers

3. Cross-validation Adjustment
   - Action: Reduced from 5-fold to 3-fold CV
   - Reasoning: Maintain rigor while improving efficiency

#### Final Model Selection
- Chosen: Gradient Boosting Regressor with MinMax scaling
- Reasoning: Best performance in initial tests, good balance of accuracy and interpretability
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Conducted to optimize model performance
- Final Performance: R2 Score of 0.8379, RMSE of 70,554.47
- Reasoning for Acceptance: Strong performance for a proof-of-concept, especially with synthetic data

## 4. Clustering Analysis

### Timeline: Week 7

#### Algorithm Selection
- Chosen: K-means clustering
- Dropped: Hierarchical clustering
- Reasoning: K-means offered a good balance of performance and computational efficiency

#### Process
1. Feature selection using mutual information and f-regression
2. Determining optimal cluster number using the elbow method
3. Settled on 5 clusters
   - Reasoning: Balance between granularity and interpretability of segments

#### Outcome
- Silhouette Score: 0.08478412337466534
- Interpretation: Indicates some structure in the data, though with overlap between clusters
- Reasoning for Acceptance: Provides meaningful segmentation for a proof-of-concept, with potential for refinement in real-world application

## 5. UI Development Pivot

### Timeline: Week 8

#### Original Plan
- Develop a full interactive user interface

#### Pivot Decision
- Switched to creating a FIGMA prototype
- Reasoning:
  1. Time constraints made full UI development unfeasible
  2. Recognition of vast differences in potential end-user integrations
  3. Alignment with the proof-of-concept nature of the project

#### FIGMA Prototype Focus
- Demonstrate potential features and user flow
- Showcase how predictive model and clustering insights could be presented
- Reasoning: Provide a visual and interactive representation of the concept without full development overhead
