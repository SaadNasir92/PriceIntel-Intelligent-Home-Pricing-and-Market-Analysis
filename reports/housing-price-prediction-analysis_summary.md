# Housing Price Prediction Project: Data Analysis Summary

## Dataset Overview

- 250,000 entries
- 28 columns (features)
- No missing values

## Target Variable: Price

- Range: $100,000 to $1,000,000
- Mean: $358,325
- Median: $350,141
- Distribution: Right-skewed, peak around $200,000-$400,000

## Key Numerical Features

### Square Footage
- Very strong positive correlation with Price (0.914)
- Linear relationship
- Crucial predictor

### Annual Income
- Strong positive correlation with Price (0.856)
- Clear positive relationship, some variance
- Range: -$14,340 to $204,982 (potential outliers)

### Credit Score
- Weak positive correlation with Price (0.001)
- Range: 300-843
- No clear linear relationship with Price

### DTI (Debt-to-Income Ratio)
- Weak negative correlation with Price (-0.003)
- Range: 0-0.85
- Higher DTI slightly associated with lower prices

### Upgrade Score
- Discrete values (1-5)
- Weak positive correlation with Price (0.001)
- Higher scores associated with wider price ranges

### Appraised Value
- No strong linear correlation with Price (-0.002)
- Scattered relationship

### Other Numerical Features
- Bedroom Count, Bathroom Count, Lot Size: Weak correlations with Price
- Closing Interest Rate: Weak negative correlation
- Loan Term: No strong relationship
- Economic Indicators (Inflation Rate, Unemployment Rate, Current Market Interest Rate): Weak correlations

## Categorical Features

### Location
- Categories: Urban, Suburban, Rural
- Relatively even distribution
- Slight differences in price distributions

### City
- 8 cities with varying distributions
- Top cities: Dallas, Aubrey, Frisco

### Marital Status
- Binary: Married, Unmarried
- Slight majority married
- Minimal impact on Price

### Current Residence
- Binary: Own, Rent
- Slightly more owners than renters
- Minimal impact on Price

### Master Location
- Binary: Upstairs, Downstairs
- Slight preference for upstairs
- Minimal impact on Price

### Feedback
- Categories: delayed, kitchen, upgrades, service
- "Delayed" most common
- No clear relationship with Price

## Time-related Features

### Closing Date
- Distributed across multiple dates
- No clear pattern visible

### Year Closed
- Range: 2020-2023
- No strong relationship with Price

## Other Observations

- Final Sentiment Score: Very weak correlation with Price (0.00059)
- Some features (e.g., Annual Income) have outliers

## Recommendations for Modeling

### Feature Engineering
1. Create interaction terms (e.g., Square Footage * Upgrade Score)
2. Bin continuous variables (Annual Income, Credit Score)
3. Extract month and year from Closing Date
4. Consider polynomial features for Square Footage and Annual Income

### Feature Selection
1. Prioritize Square Footage and Annual Income as primary predictors
2. Consider dropping or combining low-impact features (Master Location, Feedback)
3. Carefully evaluate economic indicators and time-related features

### Data Preprocessing
1. Handle outliers in Annual Income and other numerical features
2. Normalize or standardize numerical features
3. Encode categorical variables:
   - One-hot encoding for City
   - Ordinal encoding for Upgrade Score

### Model Selection
1. Start with linear models (Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge)
2. Experiment with tree-based models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
3. Consider ensemble methods

### Evaluation Metrics
1. Primary: RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
2. Secondary: MAE (Mean Absolute Error), R-squared

## Challenges to Address

1. Right-skewed distribution of the target variable (Price)
2. Handling temporal aspects (Closing Date, economic indicators)
3. Balancing model complexity with interpretability

## Next Steps

1. Implement feature engineering steps
2. Perform feature selection based on correlation analysis and domain knowledge
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Implement data preprocessing pipeline
5. Train and evaluate baseline models (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
6. Analyze model performance and iterate on feature engineering and selection
7. Experiment with advanced models and ensemble techniques
8. Fine-tune best performing model(s)
9. Prepare final model for deployment

## Additional Considerations

- Investigate potential non-linear relationships between features and Price
- Consider creating a feature importance plot after initial model training
- Explore potential interactions between categorical and numerical features
- Investigate the impact of economic indicators on different price ranges
- Consider time series analysis for temporal features if deemed significant
