# NLP Sentiment Analysis Phase Summary

## Objective
Develop a sentiment analysis component for housing feedback to extract sentiment scores, which will be used in subsequent predictive pricing models and clustering analyses.

## Methodology
1. Utilized VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) as the base sentiment analyzer.
2. Implemented custom lexicon with domain-specific terms.
3. Developed a refined scoring mechanism to handle mixed sentiments.
4. Applied sentiment analysis to a dataset of 250,000 housing feedback entries.

## Key Implementations
1. Custom lexicon addition:
   ```python
   custom_lexicon = {
       'upgrade': 2.0, 'spacious': 1.5, 'delay': -1.5, 'issue': -1.0,
       'smooth': 1.0, 'fantastic': 2.0, 'terrible': -2.0, 'happy': 1.5, 'love': 2.0
   }
   sia.lexicon.update(custom_lexicon)
   ```

2. Sentiment scoring function:
   ```python
   def get_sentiment_score(text):
       sentiment_scores = sia.polarity_scores(text)
       return sentiment_scores['compound']
   ```

3. Mixed sentiment adjustment:
   ```python
   def adjust_mixed_sentiment(text, score):
       if "but" in text.lower() or "however" in text.lower():
           return score * 0.75 if score > 0 else score * 1.25
       return score
   ```

## Results
- Sentiment score range: -0.4588 to 0.7424
- Mean sentiment score: 0.073690
- Standard deviation: 0.370224
- Eliminated neutral (0) scores

## Key Achievements
1. Successfully differentiated between positive, negative, and mixed sentiments.
2. Eliminated neutral scores, forcing the model to lean slightly positive or negative.
3. Captured nuances in mixed sentiment feedback.
4. Developed a robust sentiment analysis pipeline applicable to large datasets.

## Challenges Overcome
1. Initial bias towards neutral scores
2. Misclassification of mixed sentiments
3. Limited utilization of the full sentiment range

## Integration Point
The 'final_sentiment_score' column has been added to the original dataset, ready for use in subsequent predictive modeling and clustering analyses.

## Next Steps
1. Utilize the sentiment scores in the predictive pricing model.
2. Incorporate sentiment data into clustering analysis.
3. Monitor model performance and refine sentiment analysis if needed based on downstream results.

## Potential Future Improvements
1. Fine-tune mixed sentiment adjustment based on business priorities.
2. Expand custom lexicon based on domain expert input.
3. Implement aspect-based sentiment analysis for more granular insights.
